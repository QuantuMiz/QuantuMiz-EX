### Issue reporting/feature requests
Before you post an issue, make sure you:
* Check there is no similar/duplicate issue by searching on issue tracker page.
* Check if the issue you are about to post are already resolved by searching on issue tracker page.
* Are able to post issue in English. We cannot help you if you post non-english issue tracker. Try to use translator if you can't speak English.
* Provide more details. Do not just post 'It is not working' or 'Add feature pls' and it is NOT really helpful.
* Follow the templates when writing your issue.
* Keep the issue as one. If you have several issue to report, don't hesitate to make new one instead of having multiple issue on single issue.
* Keep the issue focused at QuantuMiz project. We cannot provide support for other subjects, and should be reported to appropriate places.

The pull request is optional but recommended if you know how does things works. We will review the code and will be applied if it's fine. We don't bite for not making a pull request ;)
